= docker-jenkins-with-latest-awscli

This repo contain Dockerfile to build Docker image from official Jenkins image but with latest awscli.

== Why?

Official image based on quite old Debian release which bundled with old awscli.
Due this, Jenkins do not able to pull from AWS Code Commit repos with AWS credentials.

== Usage

You can pull and run latest builded version from DockerHub image registry:

[source, shell]
----
docker run --name myjenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home spyl/jenkins-with-latest-awscli
----
